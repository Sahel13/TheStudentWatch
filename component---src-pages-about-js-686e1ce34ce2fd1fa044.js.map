Granted, they are the 'responsible' men and women, but college and school students are an important demographic that doesn't get adequate representation on such discussion platforms. I personally would like to know what people my age are thinking about the issues in India and in the world, especially in this particular time when our core values as a country are being attacked. This website is meant as a venue for students to air their opinions and grievances about relevant social issues, and to let their peers across India know about the problems / initiatives at their own institutes.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h2>About Me</h2>\n          <p>\n            My name is Sahel Mohammad Iqbal and I'm a student at NISER, Bhubaneswar. The only relevant introduction needed here is that I'm a believer in <a href=\"https://secure.mygov.in/read-the-preamble-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a whole host of values</a> that seem to be fast going out of fashion throughout the world in general, and in India in particular, with a special emphasis on equality and the freedom of speech and expression.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <hr css={css`border: 1px solid grey;`} />\n        <section>\n          <h3>Why the name?</h3>\n          <p>The name of the website is inspired by the concept of a neighborhood watch, which is a group of people looking out for their own neighborhood. The Student Watch doesn't strictly adhere to a similar meaning, because I would like it to stand for a group that not just looks out for the interest of the students, but for that of the nation (and perhaps even the world) as a whole.</p>\n        </section>\n      </div>\n      \n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AboutPage"],"sourceRoot":""}
